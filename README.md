# MRWaterTank
Designs for 3D printing parts and building a microcontroller to motorize a 1D Med-Tec/CNMC water tank for use in an MR-Linac

## Bill of Materials
* Manual Water Tank (e.g. MedTec/CNMC WP-3040 or similar water tank that will be safe to use in an MR environment)
* Shinsei USR30-E3N Ultrasonic Motor
* Shinsei D6060E Motor Driver
* WEMOS D1 Mini ESP8266 Microcontroller (or other Arduino-compatiple microcontroller)
* Electronics Component
  * Breadboard or PCB board
  * DB-9 connector/breakout board
  * Logic level shifter board (if using 3.3V microcontroller with 5V LCD)
  * LCD1602 with I2C module (for displaying status/location)
  * Misc. buttons/switches (for controlling motor)
  * 24V PSU for D606E
